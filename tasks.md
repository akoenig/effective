# Recording Http Client

- Make sure that the client utilizes the `@effect/platform` completely (filesystem, etc.)
- Filename of the recording should look better.
- Test (with a static API)
- Redaction functionality

# GitHub

- Tests? How?
- Semantic errors instead of type attributes (see `domain/errors.ts`)
- Integrate other endpoints
- Refresh JSDocs
- Refactor exports (only export what is really required)
- GitHub actions npm publishing flow
- Refresh README


- JSDoc for attributes in the response types (possible?)
- Integrate all the other GitHub endpoints
- Integrate Linear Notifications
